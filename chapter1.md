## Assignment 1: Basics of JavaScript

The goal of this assignment is to ensure that you have a solid understanding of the fundamental concepts of JavaScript including variables, values, types, operators, and basic programming structures.

## Task 1: Basic Arithmetic Operations

Write a JavaScript program that declares two variables, x and y, assigns them the values 10 and 5 respectively, and then performs the following operations:

Addition of x and y
Subtraction of y from x
Multiplication of x and y
Division of x by y
Modulus of x by y
For each operation, use console.log to print the result.

## Task 2: Type Conversion

Create a variable numString with the value "10" and a variable num with the value 5. Use type conversion functions to convert numString into a number and num into a string. Print the type of these variables before and after the conversion using typeof.

## Task 3: Comparing Variables

Declare two variables, a and b, and set them both to the string "5". Use both == and === to compare a and b, and print the result. Now change b to the number 5 and do the comparison again. What are your observations?

## Task 4: NaN and Undefined

Create variables that hold the values NaN and undefined. Use typeof to determine their data types. Discuss what these two special cases represent in JavaScript.

Submit your JavaScript code for each task, and include comments to explain your code and your observations. Due date is one week from today. Happy coding!
